# Travelers
A Project that hopes to solve a challenge in our city and make it an interesting area.

## The Challenge
In Kurdistan, there are a lot of ancient places and Statues of great stories and peoples, and mainly a great part of them, no one knows about the history of it, or why it was built, this App focuses on making people acquainted with our culture and history.

## Description
Anyone, especially Travelers who come to Sulaymaniyah can scan and search for the name of the place or statue and get all the details about it, in Three different Languages, Arabic, English, and Kurdish. Scanning and Searching for (statue, place, ….) are made by Scanning a QR code that will be placed next to that place (ancient places, Statues...etc.) using your Mobile Camera and it will automatically give you the information about it in the shortest time possible.
And the Best Part of it is that QR codes may get Expired or get disrupted by weather conditions and need a specific mobile version not all of them support QR codes, so for that, we came up with a solution that uses AI(Artificial Intelligence) in our implementation, we can use the camera of any mobile to scan the Statue itself, and immediately it gives all the details to the user which until now that will be the first AI being used in projects in this area, which is something has a great effect on the user, and it’s easy to use. and aid our technology and the understanding of our Culture and its history to each individual.
